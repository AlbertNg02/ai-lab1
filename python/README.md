Name: Albert Nguyen
Pledge “I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this program.”

1. Assigning the g coest as well as speeding cost correctly. What helped the most was office hours and slack messages.
2. I talked to Maria and Nalvi and Camren about some of the approaches regarding the heuristics
3. The biggest problem is writing part B with a lot of configureation from part A because I did not design the node class well for part B
4. I used double the max speed which is 130 if there is a speed option availiable.
5. This was a great assignment because it made me consider my design choices.
